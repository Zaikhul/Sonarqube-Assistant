# Sonarqube-Assistant

SonarQube Server is an industry-standard on-premises automated code review and static analysis tool designed to detect coding issues in 30+ languages, frameworks, and IaC platforms. By integrating directly with your CI pipeline or on one of our supported DevOps platforms, your code is checked against an extensive set of rules that cover many attributes of code, such as maintainability, reliability, and security issues on each merge/pull request.

As a core element of the Sonar solution, SonarQube Server completes the analysis loop to help you deliver clean code that meets high-quality standards.
